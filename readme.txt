== Description ==

###What does the plugin do?

This plugin places a Call Now button to the bottom right corner of the screen which is only visible for your mobile visitors. Because your mobile visitors are already holding their phone it will allow them to call you with one simple touch of the button. 
No more complicated copy-and-pasting or memorizing the phone number! 

###Could not be easier!
The settings are very easy: enable and enter your phone number. That's it!
